*Image 1 and 2* present the customization view of the RPE scale. When selecting the first method, the user inputs the maximum load (ignoring units — 100 kg and 100 lbs are both entered as 100) with which they can perform 1, 4, and 8 repetitions of a chosen exercise. Using the second method, the user inputs the number of repetitions they can complete with 85% and 70% of their one-rep max (1RM). After confirmation, a table displaying the RPE scale is generated.

*Image 3* shows the RPE calculator view. The user selects an exercise, enters the load (ignoring units), the number of repetitions (maximum 15), and selects the RPE level (from 5 to 10, with 0.5 step) at which the set was performed. Upon submission, a table is displayed with estimated performance outcomes, showing the weight, corresponding RPE intensity, and the number of repetitions.
